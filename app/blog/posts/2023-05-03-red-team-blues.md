title: "'Red Team Blues' by Cory Doctorow"
description: I've been a fan of Cory Doctorow for a long time, so Kickstarting Red Team Blues was an easy decision. I don't even think I looked at the description. That's why I was surprised that the novel's protagonist is a 67-year-old forensic accountant, Martin Hench. It's a refreshing choice for a main character, and I do love that Martin solves problems with intelligence and experience. A minor spoiler for one scene is that instead of getting into a fight with five younger antagonists, he figures a non-violent way out of his predicament.

My only quibble with the novel is that it was over so soon. It's a relatively short book at just over 200 pages, but at least we have two more books in the Martin Hench trilogy to look forward to.
