title: "'Book Lovers' by Emily Henry"
description: I didn't realize this would be a romance novel when I started reading it. It was in a list of books recommended to me that were book/library related. I don't normally read romance novels, so I can't comment on the genre's finer points, but I enjoyed the book. I see this becoming a rom-com movie someday, as it does a pretty good job of flipping the normal rom-com tropes on their head. The protagonist in "Book Lovers" is the high-powered career woman you hate in a regular "rom-com" and eventually is dumped in favour of the folksy hometown woman. Anyway, it was a funny book that is well worth the read.
