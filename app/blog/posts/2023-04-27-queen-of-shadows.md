title: "'Queen of Shadows' by Sarah J. Maas"
description: I'm surprised I continued with this series, as I found the earlier books were okay but not great. I only kept reading due to the encouragement of a friend. I'm glad I did continue, as book 4 of Sara J. Maas Throne of Glass series was my favourite so far. One thing that helped me enjoy this book was a flip in perspective. This is intended as a young adult series, and reading Queen of Shadows with that in mind greatly helped with my enjoyment. Looking at awards for this series, this book seemed to garner the most "best of" accolades, so, it makes sense this is the one I've liked the most.

Would I recommend picking up this series? It depends. Are you looking for a light YA fantasy series? Then yes. If you are looking for a grimdark adult fantasy series? Then hell no.
