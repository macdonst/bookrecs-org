title: "'The Cartographers' by Peng Shepherd"
description: The Cartographers is a book I should love but I can only muster up enough enthusiasm to give it a 3 start rating. An urban fantasy novel centered around the New York Public Library main branch, yes please. The characters dig into the possibility that the intentional errors map makers add to the maps in order to copyright them, "phantom settlements" if you will are in fact real. While that is an intriguing premise the execution of it left me feeling a bit confused. Continue on for minor spoilers.

_The Cartographers_ is a book I should love but I can only muster up enough enthusiasm to give it a 3 start rating. An urban fantasy novel centered around the New York Public Library main branch, yes please. The characters dig into the possibility that the intentional errors map makers add to the maps in order to copyright them, "phantom settlements" if you will are in fact real. While that is an intriguing premise the execution of it left me feeling a bit confused. Continue on for minor spoilers.

What really got me is that the characters in this novel focus in on one "phantom settlement". One character in particular is driven to do some pretty awful things to return to the settlement. This really doesn't make a ton of sense. If the all of these settlements are real why the focus on only one location? Yes, I know they tried to explain the importance late in the book but I really didn't get it.

Finally, one of the characters makes a "big decision". Even after reading the entire book I can fathom why they would make this sacrifice when they didn't need to.
