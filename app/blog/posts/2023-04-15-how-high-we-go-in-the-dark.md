title: "'How High We Go in the Dark' by Sequoia Nagamatsu"
description: Wow, I lost count of how often I thought about not finishing this book. That would be a rare occurrence for me. I would give this book a 2.5 out of 5-star rating. It's well-written but very depressing. It doesn't have a typical novel story structure. Instead, it reads like a collection of short stories on the same theme. It reminds me a lot of Station Eleven in theme and structure. The deus ex machina to end the book made me want to scream.
