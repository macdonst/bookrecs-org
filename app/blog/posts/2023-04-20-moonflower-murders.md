title: "'Moonflower Murders' by Anthony Horowitz"
description: I enjoyed the second Susan Ryeland book quite a bit. The quirk about these novels is that our "detective" is a book editor. Her biggest client writes mystery novels. Each book is like two mysteries in one. The first is the real-life crime that Susan is investigating, while the other is the mystery novel inside the novel starring Atticus Pünd. It's an interesting conceit where the novel is a meta novel. What I like about it is that I get two mysteries to solve in one book.
