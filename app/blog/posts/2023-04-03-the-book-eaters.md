title: "'The Book Eaters' by Sunyi Dean"
description: The Book Eaters is an original idea. At least, I've never come across another book in which a vampiric race sustains itself by ingesting books.  It's a gothic family horror in which the main character, Dev, must save her child, a rare type of vampire who doesn't live on books but rather by feeding on human minds. The novel's plot takes many twists and turns with it's associated double and triple crosses.

_The Book Eaters_ is an original idea. At least, I've never come across another book in which a vampiric race sustains itself by ingesting books.  It's a gothic family horror in which the main character, Dev, must save her child, a rare type of vampire who doesn't live on books but rather by feeding on human minds. The novel's plot takes many twists and turns with it's associated double and triple crosses.

I kept flipping between 3 and 4 stars on this rating, so it's a solid 3.5 stars.  While the mother's plight is relatable, the book vampires are so alien a concept I had difficulty empathizing with them. She certainly commits some reprehensible acts to ensure her son's survival.
