Last year I committed to a complete re-read of every Discworld novel. However, I skipped all of the City Watch books because they are my favourite books in the series, and I wanted to read them back to back to back to, well you get the idea.

The City Watch books are filled with IMHO the best Discworld characters: Sam Vimes, Captain Carrot, Nobby Nobbs, Angua, Fred Colon, Detritus, Littlebottom, etc. As well, I feel the City Watch books do a great job of filling us in on the machinations and motivations of Lord Vetinari, the patrician of Ankh-Morpork.

Regardless, in The Fifth Elephant we find Commander Vimes begin sent to Ãœberwald on a diplomatic mission where he is embroiled in a plot involving Dwarves, Werewolves and Vampires. I promise you it is hilarious. In a sub-plot Sgt. Fred Colon is left in charge of the City Watch while Commander Vimes is away and he is overwhelmed by the job in a very Peter Principle way.
